# Height-Measuring-Device
A device to measure height when kept at a height


This is an Arduino based Project which uses Ultrasonic Sensor to measure the delay in pulse and mutliply it with half of the speed of 
sound to get the distance of object from the sensor

This device will be setup at a height H above the ground.

Then when someone will stand below the sensor, it will read some distance D

the height of the person will be (H-D)

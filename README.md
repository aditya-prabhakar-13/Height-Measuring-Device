# Ultrasonic Height Measurement System 

This project is an **Ultrasonic Height Measurement System** built using **Arduino, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a 16x2 LCD display**. It calculates a person's height by measuring the distance from the sensor (mounted at a fixed height) to the individual's head and displays the result on an LCD screen.

##  Code Explanation  
1Ô∏è‚É£ The **HC-SR04 sensor** sends an ultrasonic pulse and measures the time for the echo to return.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The **distance to the head** is calculated using the formula:  
   ```cpp
   Distance = (Pulse Duration √ó 0.034) / 2
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ The height is determined by subtracting this distance from the sensor‚Äôs mounting height (e.g., 180 cm).
4Ô∏è‚É£ The height is displayed on the 16x2 LCD screen.

## How to Run
- Install Arduino IDE (if not already installed).
- Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
- Upload the code to the Arduino board.
- Power the circuit and view the height measurement on the LCD screen.
